Showcasing ongoing and past Data Science and Programming Projects

    General Assembly Data Science Projects

We had a weekly project assignment for the first 7 weeks of the course. These projects exercised and tested our understanding of machine learning, statistics, Python and the practical application of data science methodologies to real world problems.

- **Project 1**: SAT Scores + Summary Statistics  
*Exploratory data analysis on SAT scores from around the United States*

- **Project 2**: Lucid Titanic Sleuthing  
*Predicting who survives famous ship disasters: Titanic and Lusitania*

- **Project 3**: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression  
*Analyze county liquor sales in Iowa and make future projections*

- **Project 4**: Web Scraping for Retail Arbitrage   
*Finding underpriced RVs on Craigslist*

- **Project 5**: Titanic Via Remote DB  
*Collect data from an AWS PostgreSQL instance and analyze with logistical regression*

- **Project 6**: APIs + Random Forests  
*Classify IMDB reviews as positive or negative via NLP*

- **Project 7**: Airport Delays + Cluster Analysis  
*Analyze operational delays of major airports around the country for the FAA*
