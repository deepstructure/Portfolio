Showcasing ongoing and past Data Science and Programming Projects

    GA Data Science Program

At [General Assembly](http://example.net/), a post-graduate programming bootcamp, we had a weekly project assignment for the first 7 weeks of the course. These projects exercised and tested our understanding of machine learning, statistics, Python and the practical application of data science methodologies to real world problems.
