
Student Goals: To rectify problems in our former work and learn form our mistakes in execution, reasoning, or failures of comprehension demonstrated on previous assignments.

Concern: Projects 6 and 7 will not be returned to students with any written feedback. In-class review is ephemeral, devised on-the-fly, and non-exhaustive. As such, it is difficult to refer back to and employ towards above goal. We can see snippets of "runable" code throughout our notebooks, but can't understand when our OWN implementation of them is incorrect or poorly reasoned.Refering to the work of our peers can replicate their errors.

Proposed solution: John/Jason provide a pseudo-code "answer key" to these assignments which explains a step-by-step guide to one or multiple ways to work through the assignment, considerations, and rationale for their decisions.

Example Project 6:

1. Acquire and clean data

2. Since we are looking for an NLP comparison of highly scored films and lowly scored films, I would start to organize my data in such a way so that ______. TFIDF, XX, YY, ZZ are all methods to achieve what I need here, I'd choose _____ because it's best at ______, but if I wanted to achieve_____ I might do ______.

3. Next, start with a _________ model if I wanted to investigate ______ or a _______ if I wanted to investigate _______.

4. I noticed many people jumped right to ______ in their projects, here's why that could get you in trouble and what I would do instead.
