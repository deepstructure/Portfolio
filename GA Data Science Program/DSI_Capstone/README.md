## Overview
For my final project I wanted to do as much review as possible of the class material, but in the process realized that in doing so I'd only be able to simply gloss over it all.

So instead I did a more thorough review of our first basic concept, linear regression. Simply trying to understand as in depth as I could took weeks, but gave me a clear idea of the work necessary to do this for the rest of concepts we covered in class.

I certainly have my work cut out for me.
