# Project 4: Web Scraping for Retail ArbitrageÂ¶
Finding Underpriced RVs on Craigslist

In this project we will be practicing our web scraping skills. You can use BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium or Python requests in order to complete this project.
In order to run code from the command line, instead of the notebook, you just need to save your code to a file (with a .py extension), and run it using the Python interpreter:

`python my_file.py`

You will be building a process to scrape a single category of search results on Craigslist, that can easily be applied to other categories by changing the search terms. The main goal is to be able to target and scrape a single page given a set of parameters.
If you use Scrapy, provide your code in a folder.
