# Project Runner
  
Exploratory data analysis of the participant race times of a 5K hill run I competed in.

*NOTE:  Project is in progress and will be updated as work is completed.*  

#### Intro
On September 17th, 2016 I participated in a 
[5K run](http://www.runningguru.com/EventInformation.asp?eID=26299) at [Ascot Hills Park](https://nobodyhikesinla.com/2016/01/12/ascot-hills-park/), which true to its name hosts two large hills which the race traversed. 

According to [this tool](https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm), the starting line altitude is:  
    
    34.07176160781663,-118.18867295980453, 492.225ft. 
    
And the two peaks are:   
    
    34.07656180268046,-118.19114863872528, 712.148ft
    41,34.07350155462652,-118.18668007850647, 715.088ft
    
Which puts the total altitude difference at 223ft.

The race committee released a [pdf of the race results](http://www.aztlanathletics.org/082014/results/2016/AHC2016/ascothillschallenge2016_overall_5k.pdf), which I then put through an [online pdf OCR translator](http://www.onlineocr.net), to get the data out of it. This was mostly done correctly with a few anomalies I had to fix by hand.
